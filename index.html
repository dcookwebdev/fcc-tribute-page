            <p>C.S. Lewis: a writer of novels, stories, theology, apologetics and the like. He was a close friend and contemporary
              to the famous J.R.R. Tolkien who penned the Lord of the Rings series. </p>
            <p>Perhaps C.S. Lewis is most famously known for writing the Chronicles of Narnia series but the list of his writings
              extends far beyond. He truly had worlds of thought and poured it out with pen and paper.</p>

            <h2>A Brief Biography</h2>
            <p>
              <b>Clive Staples Lewis</b> was born in Ireland in Belfast to Albert and Florence Lewis. At the age of 9 his mother
              died from cancer. After graduating he went to English for University but was sent off to fight in the war which
              encouraged him more towards atheism. After returning from the war and recovering from some injuries, he returned
              to his studies.</p>
            <p>
              <b>Lewis was greatly cared for</b> by a fellow cadet's mother, Jane Moore. Lewis had made a pact to care for the
              family if his fellow cadet died in the war, and so it was. He grew incredibly fond of Jane, even introducing
              her as his mother. This was a very important relationship for Lewis.</p>
            <p>
              <b>After being persuaded</b> by friends and philosophical arguments, Lewis returned to Christianity. Later, he
              married Joy Davidman Gresham but she died some years later from cancer. Lewis himself died just before his
              65th birthday after several health difficulties.
