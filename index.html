          <h2>Worlds of Thought</h2>
        </header>
        <p>C.S. Lewis: a writer of novels, stories, theology, apologetics and the like. He was a close friend and
          contemporary
          to the famous J.R.R. Tolkien who penned the Lord of the Rings series. </p>
        <p>Perhaps C.S. Lewis is most famously known for writing the Chronicles of Narnia series but the list of his
          writings
          extends far beyond. He truly had worlds of thought and poured it out with pen and paper.</p>

          <h2>A Brief Biography</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          <b>Clive Staples Lewis</b> was born in Ireland in Belfast to Albert and Florence Lewis. At the age of 9 his
          mother
          died from cancer. After graduating he went to English for University but was sent off to fight in the war
          which
          encouraged him more towards atheism. After returning from the war and recovering from some injuries, he
          returned
          to his studies.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Lewis was greatly cared for</b> by a fellow cadet's mother, Jane Moore. Lewis had made a pact to care for
          the
          family if his fellow cadet died in the war, and so it was. He grew incredibly fond of Jane, even introducing
          her as his mother. This was a very important relationship for Lewis.</p>
        <p>
          <b>After being persuaded</b> by friends and philosophical arguments, Lewis returned to Christianity. Later, he
          married Joy Davidman Gresham but she died some years later from cancer. Lewis himself died just before his
          65th birthday after several health difficulties.
