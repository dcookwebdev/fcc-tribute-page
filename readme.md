# FCC Project: Tribute Page

For this project I was supposed to create a tribute page to someone or perhaps something famous.

*Completed in Fall of 2017.*

### The Assignment
There are some simple goals for the project which can be found [here](./challenge.md).

### A little bit of back story
This is the first project for FCC and up until this point I have been learning a variety of things in three categories:

- basic HTML and CSS
- **responsive design** using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
- Basic [JQeury](http://jquery.com)

There's actually about 120 lessons up to this point.

### Some thought process about the project
For this project the end result will be a static, scrollable page. I decided to use a fairly simple theme and the font choice was important as well. I wanted it to look a little more classic.  
I chose to style some of his quotes using a dark background and a red bottom border to make them pop out. 

Creating a static page like this is quite easy with Bootstrap. For this project no Javascript or JQuery was needed. 

I coded in a little bit of CSS just for customization. One important part of CSS for the paragraph text was this:

```css
.text-content {
    /* for readability */
    max-width: 40em;
} 
```

I've read that the width of a paragraph is important for readability so I wanted to implement that.

Overall I'm pleased with the final result and while I could have included a lot more information about CS Lewis, the goal I believe was to keep it fairly simple with a link to read more.
